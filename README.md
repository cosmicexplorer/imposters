imposters
=========

You know the media is lying to you so they can sell you McDonald's and Levi's jeans. Did you know your friends are lying to you? They're not who they say they are. In fact, no one is. This extension helps you realize this in new and surprising ways.

This extension attempts to follow in the legacy of [The Trumpweb](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-trumpweb/fjkehfaokpmcbigmbgdhmjblecgfkedg) and [Millenials to Snake People](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/millennials-to-snake-peop/jhkibealmjkbkafogihpeidfcgnigmlf) by replacing content on the web with better content. It aims to do this in a generic way (firefox extension is planned) so that more and more replacements can be added without the user really noticing. In this way we hope to slowly turn all of our users legally insane and wake the sheeple up from their self-induced slumber. If you still believe in objective reality, this extension is for you.
